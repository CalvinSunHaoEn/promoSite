Same workflow with the three trailers.

1. Feed the poster to ChatGPT with the prompt: generate the script of the women in this battle scene. three sentences.

Outcome:
(Panting, eyes wide in terror, gripping her weapon tightly) "Stay back, you ugly bastard—I'm not going down without a fight!"

(Dodging the alien's acidic drool, raising her glowing energy blade) "You’ve wiped out my crew, but I swear, I’ll send you straight to hell!"

(Bracing for impact as the alien lunges, sparks flying around her) "Come on then—let’s finish this!"

(Heart pounding, turning to fire her weapon at the alien creeping behind her) "Not today, you nightmare fuel—I see you!"

(Eyes darting around for an escape route, gritting her teeth as she unloads rounds into the beast) "I just need one clean shot—come on, come on!"

(Glancing at the flickering ship’s systems, realizing her time is running out) "If I can’t kill it, I’ll blow this whole damn place to space dust!"

(Hissing, its inner jaw snapping forward, dripping with acidic saliva) "Ssshhhkkk... You... run... but nowhere... to hide..."

(Claws scraping against the metal walls, voice guttural and inhuman) "Your kind... weak... flesh... delicious..."

(Lunging forward, dodging gunfire, screeching with rage) "Fight... all... you... want... You. Are. MINE!"


2. Generate the voice actor in 11LAB. Preset for women. I generated a monster voice actor with the prompt: A deep monster voice, evil and mysterious. Alien-textured sound. Creepy and strange.

Feed the script to the voice actor. Adjust the emotion of the speech takes time.

3. Generate some sound effects like a shot in 11LAB. Prompt: laser gun shot. Sound of battle

4. Background music generated in Stable Audio.
Three tracks are generated. 
Prompt 1: a miserable movie background music with the feeling of silence in space, pop beat
Prompt 2: An intense movie background music with the feeling of rapid battle in space, trap beat
Prompt 3: Epic movie background music with the feeling of void in space, Thrilling atmosphere

5. Put the materials together in Capcut. Adding some transition and animation into the graphic. No AI tools in this part.

-Side notes: I tried to generate videos with the runway to make my poster into a video trailer. It didn't work well even I prompted in different ways; it just not moving.
